## Executive Summary 
I have learned that Microsoft plays a big role in computers. I didn't realize how much they put into every single part of how a computer works. Virtualization is super helpful when trying to use a machine's full capacity rather than keeping everything on one file. Handshake is a super cool way to find internships and job in my field. 

## Software - Operating systems are used for: managing the hardware resources of the computer, providing the user-interface components, and providing a platform for software developers to write applications; i.e. Microsoft Windows.  Application software is utilized directly today to accomplish a specific goal such as word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or surfing the Internet using your favorite browser; i.e. the Microsoft Office Suite. Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way; i.e. McAfee Virus Protection.
### Types of Software - Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office Suite, and McAfee Virus Protection.
### ERP - The Enterprise Resource Planning system was developed to bring together an entire organization within one program; i.e. Microsoft.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization - Virtualization allows you to use a physical machineâ€™s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
### Role of Hypervisor - Hypervisors enabled virtualization by giving multiple users simultaneous access to computers that performed batch processing.

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python - The Pseudo-Code Nature of Python is meant to make it easier for programmers to code. It puts the coding language into English to be better understood.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language - A compiled program must be converted into a different format before it is run. Interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running, while compiled language programs cannot.  

## Career Exploration
### Handshake - It's nice to have a resource for finding internships and future jobs. Handshake is super helpful to letting you know what internships are paid vs. unpaid and it helps narrow down what jobs accept your degree and level of education. 
### Bureau of Labor Statistics - My findings are that most jobs require a Bachelor's Degree and most of them don't have on the job training and want 5 or more years of expereince in a similar field. 
### Certifications - The certifications for the cybersecurity peaked my interest, although I didn't want to input my contact information at this time to learn about pricing. 
### Certificates and Degrees - I looked at the Post-Degree for Cybersecurity in this field and I would only have to take a few extra classes to get my certification. 
### Co-ops / Internships - In order to do Co-Op you have to go through an orientation process and upload a resume along with talk to a Specialist to help you apply and interview. 
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations - Joining the Cybersecurity Club would be beneficial as I am already interested into going into the Cybersecurity field. We were not able to contact him as we worked on this during the weekend but I will look into contacting him for more information later this week. 

## Conclusion - Python was difficult at first but, after messing around with it and asking a fellow programmer that has his bachelor's degree in IT, I found it much easier. Once I start looking for internships and a new job, Handshake will be my best friend.
