## Executive Summary 
The purpose of Lab 2 is to teach us about the internal parts of the computer. The  basic internal processes are to Input, Store, Process, and Output information. I was fascinated to learn that refrigerators and cars are being more intergrated into technology as digital devices. I also found that understanding binary is like understanding scientific notation.

## Hardware - any device you can physically touch
### Hard Drives and Memory - a hard disk drive is considered non-volatile storage because when the computer is turned off the data remains in storage on the disk, ready for when the computer is turned on. Memory refers to the component within your computer that allows for short-term data access.
#### Latency and Transfer Rates - Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head as Transfer rates are the time it takes for data to transfer to and from the inner and outer diameters of the disk.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives - Solid state drives want no moving parts where as hard drives consist of spinning platters and moving heads.
#### Random Access Memory - Increasing the amount of RAM makes the computer work faster because you increase the memory and more data can be loaded into the RAM and not have to constantly access the slower Hard Drive. DIMMS can trasnfer 64 bits of data at a time which is much faster than a SIMMS which can only transfer 32 bits of data within a clock cycle, that's twice as much data.
### ALU and the Control Unit - the ALU performs mathematical equations such as addition and subtraction inside the CPU. The control unit serves as RAM and breaks down information for the smaller parts
### CPU, Input & Output - Input is the pump where you insert your card and selection of gas, The CPU is the pump computing how much gas/money you're putting into your car, and the output is the nozzle filling your car with gas.
### Logic Gates - A Truth Table is meant to summarize the and/or tables quickly and simply. AND Gate Truth Table only has an output if both inputs are filled, whereas the OR Gate Truth Table has an ouput even if only one input is filled. 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design - The purpose of IEEE is to advance technology, their focus is to foster awareness on technical issues, promote ethical behavior in the technical field, and create a world where engineers and scientists are respected for their ethical behavior. 

## Data Representation - the way that the physical properties of a medium are used to represent data.
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal - decimal goes by 10, binary has base 2, and hexidecimal has base of 16.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation - the color #ab00ff represents a purple hue. It would be problematic for website usage because it's high in red and it's complimentary color is green and most people who are colorblind have a sensitivity to reds and greens.

## Conclusion
Why are more men painters in the car industry than women? I ask this due to only 0.5% of women and 8% of men are color sensitive. I didn't know converting decimals into different types would be as easy as it is. This lab truly gave me a deeper understanding of computers and how they work faster. Although this lab had a lot more to do within it, it was much easier than Lab 1 since I actually knew what I was doing.
