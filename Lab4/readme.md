## Executive Summary 
I didn't know there were two different ways to view graphics. The amount of data types were also unknown to me so I'm glad I was able to read and learn more about them. I also didn't realize that there two different types of variables; math variables and then computer variables. 

## Python IDLE: Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. However, in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor. IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the above two needs and bundled them as a package. 

## Code Examples
### Variable:  a piece of data that can change. The reason why the author uses spam and bacon and eggs is so you can visually see what is being added. 
### Assignment statement: give a variable a value
### Function: a set of instructions bundled together to achieve a specific outcome.
### Three data types: int (integer numbers), double (decimal numbers), and boolean (true or false)

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics:Vector graphics are digital art that is rendered by a computer using a mathematical formula. Raster images are made up of tiny pixels, making them resolution dependent and best used for creating photos. Vector graphics would be more appropriate to use due to when zooming in, the images do not pixelate.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression: lossless image compression means all the data from the original file is preserved. Lossy compression, on the other hand, removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size.
### File Formats: JPEG works best for storing full cover images full of complex shading and color variation. GIF as it is newer supports more colors and is free of patent restrictions PNG cannot be used for animations but offers highly sophisticated transparency and color support among other features.
### File Properties: 

## Conclusion

Working with the Command Prompt was more difficult than I thought it would be. I previously worked with it in my computer class at OTC, so once I started messing with it, all the information came back to me and it was much easier to figure out. I really enjoy using Python. Obviously working with it last week was much more difficult than this week since I finally knew what I was doing. I like the fact that we were able to make our own logos.
