## Executive Summary 
It was nice learning about Tim Berners Lee and how he created W3C. It was also nice learning about all the different layers for applications. The risks were also super interesting to read about as anything we use could potentially have a risk of either a hacker or spam mail.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are the unique numbers assigned to every computer or device that is connected to the Internet. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals, which can fit more information into fewer digits. 
#### ICANN: It is a not-for-profit partnership of people from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers.

### TCP/IP: TCP/IP stands for “Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol”. 
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP: It is basically a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware. 
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP: The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.  
#### Layers: Network layers are important because they enable developers to work at their appropriate levels, and ensure that everyone is able to run everything on their own.
#### Application Layer: SMTP,FTP,HTTP,POP3,IMAP4,SNMP

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model: HTTP is abbreviated as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, an application layer protocol used primarily with the WWW (World Wide Web) in the client-server model where a web browser is a client communicating with the webserver which is hosting the website. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP: an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser: the web browser that comes with an operating system is not set up in a secure default configuration. Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
### Risk Explained: One problem with using ActiveX in a web browser is that it greatly increases the attack surface, or “attackability,” of a system. Installing any Windows application introduces the possibility of new ActiveX controls being installed. Vulnerabilities in ActiveX objects may be exploited via Internet Explorer, even if the object was never designed to be used in a web browser

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium: The World Wide Web Consortium achieves its mission by bringing diverse stake-holders together, under a clear and effective consensus-based process to develop high-quality standards based on contributions from the W3C Members, staff, and the community at large. Tim Berner's Lee is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to describe data. The XML standard is a flexible way to create information formats and electronically share structured data via the public Internet, as well as via corporate networks. 
### HTML5 and CSS: CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
### HTML and XML: XML is the acronym from Extensible Markup Language (meta-language of noting/marking). XML is a resembling language with HTML. It was developed for describing data. The XML tags are not pre-defined in XML. You will have to create tags according to your needs.

## Components of a URL :domain- www.amazon.com , top level domain-.edu, scheme- https, default page- result of search, parameters- no file path provided, anchor- specific location on a page 

## Conclusion
I already learned about the domain names when I was in computer class at OTC. There were LOTS of images included in this lab and while submitting I had to make a list of all of them to make sure they're all included. While trying to upload my image to my web page I did have a hard time getting them to show up properly. I hope that it is good enough as I tried everything I could to make it work.
