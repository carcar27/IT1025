<h1>THE RAINBOW CAT CAFE</h1>
<p>The rainbow cat cafe is an LGBTQ+ save space for people who donâ€™t like to drink alcohol or feel uncomfortable at a gay bar. It's a place where you get to drink coffee, teas, and Hot chocolate etc. and are surrounded by adoptable cats and kittens. Where you can quietly do your homework or read a book or catch up with some friends that you haven't seen in a while. Also, you can always bring your first date here because I know meeting someone online doesn't always go as well as it should..</p>
