## Executive Summary
Well, the purpose of lab one is to show the concept of programming for IT 1025 the history of computing and how to set up our own GitHub. In the chapters I've read several definitions that focused on how technology people process and their main components. They use of information systems that companies use has evolved over the years from using large computers to two computers that are handheld. 
## 1. Hardware 2. Software 3. Data 4. People 5. Processes

## Is a provider internet hosting for software development inversions controlled using git 
### An ERP system is an application with a centralized database that can be used to run a companyâ€™s entire business. 
### Cloud computing provides users with mobile access to data and applications, making the PC more of a part of the communications channel rather than a repository of programs and information

## Conclusion
I have found that lab on his shown materials and skills that I need to learn about and adapt to also found that GitHub was a little difficult for me to set up but once I got a hang of it went pretty smooth I also need to learn to read my material before I try to figure things out and do them without having knowledge of the task at hand I'm now ready to spend more time on the computer and learn more about IT.
