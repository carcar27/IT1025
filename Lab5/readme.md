## Introduction to Networking: Network communication is full of some very technical concepts based on simple principles.

### Data Transmission
#### Packet: Unit of data  
#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address: Unique identifying number 

#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 

#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub: This maximizes security and efficiency of the network. This means that messages have to be transmitted out of every port of the hub, greatly degrading the efficiency of the network.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub: advantage of the Routers over Hub and Switch is the Firewall.
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure: is a potential risk posed by a flaw in the design, implementation or configuration of a circuit or system in which one fault or malfunction causes an entire system to stop operating. Ring and star
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh: awareness means knowing all the details of your infrastructure. Is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. 
### Network Design: mesh network
### NSA/CSS: leads the U.S. Government in cryptology that encompasses both signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance (now referred to as cybersecurity) products and services

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
#### Authentication
#### ACL and RBAC: An ACL is a list of user permissions for a file, folder, or other object. ACLs are simple to understand and maintain. The primary drawback is that each information resource is managed separately. RBAC allows permissions to be assigned to roles. Improving compliance. All organizations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. Not involving business users during the process of defining roles    
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key: the sender on the left creates a plaintext message which is then encrypted with a public key. The ciphered text is transmitted through the communication channel and the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message and then read the plain text.
#### Public Key Cryptography: Public key Encryption is important because it is infeasible to determine the decryption key given only the knowledge of the cryptographic algorithm and encryption key.

### Cryptography
#### Encryption:cryptography is a growing field- lahcxpajyqh rb j paxfrwp ornum (10 letter shift)
#### Frequency Fingerprint: we use a lot of vowel is our words 
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher: A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. 
#### Polyalphabetic Example: Its a werid way to encrytion things. 

#### Brute-Force: A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher.
