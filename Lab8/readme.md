## Executive Summary 
I didn't realize during the SQL reading that those things were able to be done. I didn't know that SQL injection attacks could happen, I didn't know anything about them. It was nice having a refresher about HIPPA.

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge: Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent. Information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose. Knowledge in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area. The words data, information, and knowledge are often used interchangeably.    

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key::the customer number column is the primary key of the customers table  
#### Relationship between customers and orders:The customer number column in orders therefore serves to relate orders to the customers to which they belong.
#### Foreign key of orders table: that the same column is a foreign key in the orders table.
### Field Data Types: A data type tells the database what functions can be performed with the data. To define the data type is so that the proper amount of storage space is allocated for the data

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data:  Volume – The name Big Data itself is related to a size which is enormous. Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. The term ‘velocity’ refers to the speed of generation of data. Variability – This refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data: Data technologies can be used for creating a staging area or landing zone for new data before identifying what data should be moved to the data warehouse. In addition, such integration of Big Data technologies and data warehouse helps an organization to offload infrequently accessed data.

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections: a SQL injection attack, an attacker submits to a website information that has been deliberately formulated in such a way that it results in that website misinterpreting it and taking unintended actions. Sanitization usually involves running any submitted data through a function (such as MySQL’s mysql_real_escape_string() function) to ensure that any dangerous characters such as ‘ are not passed to a SQL query in data.

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics: A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group.The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way.
### Intellectual Property: A trademark is a form of intellectual property, which appears in the form of some recognizable design, phrase, or expression that serves to identify products or services produced by one source, over those produced by another.
### Information Collection: comply with COPPA, organizations must make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain parental consent before collecting any information. FERPA- this law specifies that parents have a right to their child’s educational information until the child reaches either the age of eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level. At that point, control of the information is given to the child. HIPPA- This law gives patients specific rights to control their medical records, requires health care providers and others who maintain this information to get specific permission in order to share it, and imposes penalties on the institutions that breach this trust.

## Conclusion
The SQL "try it" section was a little hard at first but once I found what I was doing, it was much easier. I really enjoyed this class and I'm glad that I was able to take part in it. It really opened my horizons into the programming world.
