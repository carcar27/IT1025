## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression: File compression is commonly used when sending a file from one computer to another over a connection that has limited bandwidth. The compression basically makes the file smaller and, therefore, the sending of the file is faster.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes: Class — A blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class.
### Methods: Because these functions are indented under the class Shark, they are called methods. Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class.
### Constructor: The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
### Class vs. Object: Class — A blueprint created by a programmer for an object An object is an instance of a class. We can take the Shark class defined above, and use it to create an object or instance of it. The meaning of instantiating an object is to be able to create an instance of the object by using an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects: Objects are persons, places, or things that are relevant to the system we are analyzing. Object-oriented systems describe entities as objects
### Inheritance: Inheritance reduces programming labor by using common objects easily. 
### Encapsulation and Abstraction: Abstraction shows only useful data by providing the most necessary details whereas Encapsulation wraps code and data for necessary information.
